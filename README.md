Instapocket is a simple tool to copy and paste text from a webpage to a .txt file. 

I did it because I like to edit the texts I write for a website on Sublime, but sometimes I forget to save the drafts. Now, every time I want to review and change some text I wrote for the web, I use this to paste the plain text, without the .html tags.
