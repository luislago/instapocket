	Madeleine Albright to Congress: Authorize Obama's Syria plan - POLITICO.com
	
	Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wants Congress to authorize President Barack Obama to use force in Syria, adding her name to a growing and bipartisan list of outside validators who have rallied to the president's cause.
"I urge Congress to vote 'yes' on the resolution authorizing a military response to Bashar Assad's illegal and immoral use of chemical weapons to murder more than one thousand innocent people,"  Albright, who served as secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, said in a statement.
Albright, who has been in contact with some lawmakers, felt strongly about the vote and wanted to make her views known.(WATCH: State Department 'confident' in Congress to vote for Syria)Obama, who will make a national address on Syria Tuesday night, can use all the help he can get as he faces a Congress that is deeply reluctant to authorize military strikes against Assad. Of late, he's picked up pubic support from an array of foreign policy heavyweights, including Albright, former Defense secretaries Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"The dangers of this world will only deepen if aggressors believe that global norms have no meaning and that gross violations can be carried out with impunity," Albright said. "The belief that the United States can insulate itself from peril by standing aside or by waiting for others to act is an illusion mocked by the lessons of history. There are many complex issues associated with the Syrian civil war -- this vote by Congress at this time is not one of them."(Quiz: Do you know U.S.-Syria news?)
